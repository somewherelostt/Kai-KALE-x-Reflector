## 🚀 HACKATHON SUBMISSION: Stellar × KALE × Reflector

**Challenge:** Build on KALE and/or Reflector to create targeted innovation that leverages these projects as foundational layers.

**Our Solution:** Enhanced KaizenX with **KALE Event Staking** + **Reflector Dynamic Pricing** to create a next-generation event platform that combines:
- 🌾 **KALE's proof-of-teamwork mechanics** for organizer commitment & anti-spam attendance
- 📊 **Reflector's live oracle data** for real-time multi-currency pricing & market dynamics
- 🎫 **Our existing event infrastructure** for seamless user experience

---

## 🌟 NEW: Hackathon Integration Features

### 🌾 **KALE Event Staking System**

**Innovation:** Transform events into proof-of-commitment experiences using KALE's farming mechanics.

**How it works:**
- **Organizers** stake 1000+ KALE tokens when creating events (proves serious commitment)
- **Attendees** stake 10+ KALE tokens to join events (anti-spam + skin-in-the-game)
- **Post-Event:** Actual attendees get their stake back + 20% bonus from organizer's reward pool
- **No-shows** forfeit their stake, which gets distributed to people who actually showed up

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Reduces no-shows** by requiring financial commitment from attendees
- ✅ **Proves organizer reliability** through significant stake requirements  
- ✅ **Creates reward incentives** for actual event participation
- ✅ **Leverages KALE's mining ecosystem** - users can farm KALE then stake it for events

### 📊 **Reflector Dynamic Pricing System**

**Innovation:** Real-time event pricing that adapts to market conditions and demand using Reflector's oracle network.

**Features:**
- **Live Price Feeds:** Event prices update based on XLM/USD rates from Reflector
- **Multi-Currency Display:** Show prices in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY automatically
- **Surge Pricing:** Dynamic demand multipliers (1.0x to 3.0x) based on ticket sales velocity
- **Market Buffers:** 5% volatility protection to prevent price shock during crypto swings
- **Global Accessibility:** International users see local currency equivalents

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Fair market pricing** that reflects real economic conditions
- ✅ **Revenue optimization** through intelligent demand-based adjustments
- ✅ **Global inclusivity** via multi-currency support
- ✅ **Real-time updates** every 30 seconds via Reflector's push-based oracles

### 🔗 **Seamless Integration**

Our hackathon features integrate naturally with existing KaizenX infrastructure:
- **Enhanced Event Creation:** 3-step wizard with KALE staking + dynamic pricing configuration
- **Smart Contract Extensions:** New staking contracts work alongside existing event contracts  
- **Unified UI:** KALE and Reflector features embedded in familiar event interfaces
- **Wallet Integration:** Leverages existing Freighter/Stellar wallet connections
